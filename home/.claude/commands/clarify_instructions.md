The file $ARGUMENTS contains instructions for how to achieve a future goal. Follow these steps:

1. Identify gaps in the instructions and show them to me.
2. Don't make assumptions or guesses about how the gaps should be filled in.
3. To fill in the gaps, ask me each clarifying question one at a time.
4. When all of the gaps have been filled, create an updated version of the file that covers the gaps that you identified. The new file must be in Markdown format and have the suffix `-optimized`. For example, `foo_bar-optimized.md`
