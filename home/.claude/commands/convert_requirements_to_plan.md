The file $ARGUMENTS contains the requirements for a new feature to build. Follow these steps:

1. Read and analyze the requirements in $ARGUMENTS

   - Identify the main goal and any sub-goals
   - Note any constraints, requirements, or success criteria mentioned

2. Create a comprehensive plan to achieve the goal:

   - Break the plan into logical phases, with each phase having one clear objective
   - Within each phase, define specific, actionable steps
   - For each step, specify:
     - What needs to be done
     - How to do it
     - Success criteria or deliverables

3. Review and refine the plan:

   - Check for gaps, missing steps, or unclear instructions
   - Identify potential risks, obstacles, or failure points
   - Add mitigation strategies for identified risks
   - Ensure steps are in logical order with proper dependencies
   - Verify that the plan actually achieves the stated goal
   - Add alternative approaches for critical steps where appropriate

4. Format and save the plan:
   - Write the plan in clear, well-structured Markdown format
   - Include an executive summary at the top
   - Include an overview of the phases near the top of the plan
   - Use consistent formatting with headers, bullet points, and numbered lists
   - Save the plan to a file named `plan.md` in the same directory as $ARGUMENTS
