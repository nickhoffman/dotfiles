The instructions mention using Chrome's Download API but don't specify the required permissions (e.g., `downloads`, `activeTab`, `host_permissions`).\n\n3. **Data Storage**: How should the download queue and status information be persisted? Should it use:\n   - Chrome's storage API (sync or local)?\n   - In-memory storage that's lost on extension restart?\n   - IndexedDB for large datasets?\n\n4. **Error Handling Specifics**: What specific errors should be handled during downloading? For example:\n   - Network timeouts\n   - 404 errors\n   - Permission denied errors\n   - Disk space issues\n   - Invalid image formats\n\n5. **UI/UX Details**: \n   - What should happen if a user tries to download from multiple pages simultaneously?\n   - Should there be a global download limit across all pages?\n   - How should the download button behave if downloads are already in progress for that page?\n\n6. **File Naming Strategy**: How should filename conflicts be handled when multiple images have the same name within a page's download directory?\n\n7. **Download Directory Setting**: The instructions mention a \"download directory\" setting but don't specify:\n   - What the default value should be\n   - How users can change this setting\n   - Whether it should be a full path or relative to the default downloads folder\n\n8. **Testing Strategy**: What testing approach should be used for:\n   - Content script injection\n   - Chrome API interactions\n   - Download progress tracking\n   - Error scenarios\n\n9. **Performance Considerations**: Should there be any limits on:\n   - Maximum number of images that can be queued from a single page?\n   - Maximum file size for individual downloads?\n   - Memory usage for tracking download progress?\n\n10. **Security Considerations**: How should the extension handle:\n    - Cross-origin requests for images?\n    - Potentially malicious image URLs?\n    - User privacy when downloading from adult content sites?\n\nNow I'll create the optimized version of the instructions file:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2177,"cache_read_input_tokens":15469,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQjLcDzmDqvrRV4uQobV9","type":"assistant","uuid":"49ca2a2d-b73c-4d21-806e-cd954854241b","timestamp":"2025-07-03T03:00:50.543Z"}

Thus, it should be encapsulated in one place, and given the logic that's specific to the page to download images from. It will use that logic to get the page's title and URLs of images to download, and then queue the images to be downloaded.\n- The logic that will differ between supported pages will be:\n  - How to get the supported page's title. This will be a function that:\n    - Accepts a prop that is the page's document.\n    - Returns a string that is the page's title.\n  - How to get the URLs for the images that are downloadable. This will be a function that:\n    - Accepts a prop that is the page's document.\n    - Returns an array of strings that are the URLs of images to download.\n\n### Localhost Image Test Album\n\n- URL Domain: 127.0.0.1:4000\n- URL Path: /test.html\n- Logic to get the page's title:\n  1.

Find the <h1> element that matches this CSS selector: `#album .title h1`\n  2. In the <h1> element that was found, replace with \"\" the part of its text content that matches this regular expression: `/Porn Pictures, XXX Photos, Sex Images #[0-9]+ - PICTOA/`\n  3. Return the modified text content from the previous step.\n- Logic to get the URLs for the downloadable images:\n  1. Find the <img> elements that match this CSS selector: `#album .cover-box a.gallery-link img`\n  2. For each <img> element that was found:\n     2.1. Get its URL from the `data-lazy-src` attribute. If that returns null or an empty string, get its URL from the `src` attribute.\n     2.2. Replace `t1.pictoa.com` in the URL's domain with `s1.pictoa.com`\n  3. Return the modified URLs from the previous step.\n\nThe HTML for an example page to use for testing can be found at @src/test/fixtures/pictoa_image_test_album.html\n\n## Download Icon\n\nThe download icon is a rocket emoji (🚀) that's centered in a box. The box has rounded corners, is anchored to the bottom-right corner of the page, and floats on top of the page.\n\n### Download Icon Implementation Details\n\n- **Injection Method**: Use a content script to inject the download button into supported pages\n- **Positioning**: Fixed position (bottom: 20px, right: 20px) with high z-index (9999)\n- **Styling**: \n  - Background color: semi-transparent dark background\n  - Border radius: 12px\n  - Padding: 12px\n  - Box shadow for depth\n  - Cursor pointer on hover\n- **Visibility**: Only show when page is detected as supported and not already downloading\n- **Animation**: Subtle pulse animation to indicate interactivity\n\n## Downloading\n\n- Allow a maximum of 10 images to be downloaded in parallel per page. When a download finishes or fails, start downloading the next image in the queue for that page.\n- Use Chrome's Download API to download images and track each download's progress, completion, and errors.\n- Downloaded images should be stored in a directory whose name is the page's title. And that directory must be inside of the \"download directory\" setting that the extension stores.\n\n### Download Implementation Details\n\n- **Global Download Limit**: Maximum 20 simultaneous downloads across all pages\n- **Per-page Download Limit**: Maximum 10 simultaneous downloads per page\n- **Queue Management**: First-in-first-out (FIFO) queue for each page\n- **File Naming**: \n  - Use original filename from URL when possible\n  - Handle conflicts by appending incrementing numbers (e.g., image.jpg, image_1.jpg, image_2.jpg)\n  - Sanitize filenames to remove invalid characters\n- **Download Directory**: \n  - Default to Chrome's default download directory + \"ExtensionDownloads\"\n  - Allow user to configure in settings\n  - Create page-specific subdirectories using sanitized page titles\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Retry failed downloads up to 3 times with exponential backoff\n  - Handle network timeouts (30 second timeout per download)\n  - Handle 404/403 errors gracefully\n  - Handle disk space issues\n  - Handle invalid image formats\n- **Progress Tracking**: Use Chrome downloads API progress events\n- **File Validation**: Verify downloaded files are valid images\n\n## \"Downloads\" tab\n\nThe section describes how information about queued images are displayed in the \"Downloads\" tab.\n\n- Downloaded images are grouped by page that they were downloaded from.\n  - Each group has a title, which is the extracted title from the page that the images were downloaded from.\n  - Under each group's title, the page's URL is displayed as a link. Clicking the link opens the page in a new browser tab.\n  - Each group has an icon representing the aggregate status of the downloads in the group. The status is defined with the following logic:\n    - If any images are being downloaded, the group's status is \"downloading\".\n    - Else if any images failed to download, the group's status is \"failed\".\n    - Else if any images are cancelled, the group's status is \"cancelled\".\n    - Else if any images are pending, the group's status is \"pending\".\n    - Else (all images have downloaded successfully), the group's status is \"downloaded\".\n  - Each group has an icon/button to retry all of the downloads that have failed or are pending.\n  - Each group has an icon/button to cancel all of the downloads whose status is not \"downloaded\".\n- The following information should be displayed for each queued image:\n  - Status: pending, downloading, downloaded, failed, or cancelled. Use an icon to represent this status. Hovering over the icon shows a tooltip that shows the 1-word status.\n  - Filename: The name of the image being downloaded.\n- While an image is not downloading yet:\n  - Its status is \"pending\".\n- While an image is downloading:\n  - Its status is \"downloading\".\n  - A progress bar shows the progress of the download.\n- When an image has finished downloading:\n  - Its status is \"downloaded\".\n  - Its progress bar is removed.\n- When an image has failed to download:\n  - Its status is \"failed\".\n  - Its progress bar is removed.\n  - A button or icon is displayed to retry the download.\n- When an image has been cancelled:\n  - Its status is \"cancelled\".\n  - Its progress bar is removed.\n  - A button or icon is displayed to retry the download.\n\n### Downloads Tab Implementation Details\n\n- **Real-time Updates**: Use Chrome storage API with listeners for live updates\n- **Pagination**: Show 50 images per page with pagination controls\n- **Filtering**: Allow filtering by status (all, pending, downloading, downloaded, failed, cancelled)\n- **Sorting**: Sort by date queued (newest first) with option to sort by status\n- **Bulk Operations**: \n  - Select all/none checkboxes\n  - Bulk retry/cancel operations\n  - Clear completed downloads\n- **Statistics**: Show total/completed/failed counts per group\n- **Memory Management**: Limit stored download history to 1000 items, auto-cleanup old entries\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Required Chrome Extensions Permissions\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"downloads\",\n    \"storage\",\n    \"activeTab\",\n    \"scripting\"\n  ],\n  \"host_permissions\": [\n    \"http://127.0.0.1:4000/*\",\n    \"https://pictoa.com/*\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Data Storage Strategy\n\n- **Chrome Storage Local**: Store download queue, settings, and download history\n- **Data Structure**:\n  ```typescript\n  interface DownloadGroup {\n    id: string;\n    pageTitle: string;\n    pageUrl: string;\n    dateCreated: number;\n    downloads: DownloadItem[];\n  }\n  \n  interface DownloadItem {\n    id: string;\n    url: string;\n    filename: string;\n    status: 'pending' | 'downloading' | 'downloaded' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';\n    progress: number;\n    error?: string;\n    chromeDownloadId?: number;\n    retryCount: number;\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Component Architecture\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/\n│   ├── downloads_tab/\n│   │   ├── DownloadsTab.tsx\n│   │   ├── DownloadGroup.tsx\n│   │   ├── DownloadItem.tsx\n│   │   └── DownloadProgress.tsx\n│   └── content_script/\n│       └── DownloadButton.tsx\n├── services/\n│   ├── download_manager.ts\n│   ├── page_detectors.ts\n│   └── chrome_downloads.ts\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── useDownloads.ts\n│   └── useDownloadProgress.ts\n└── content_scripts/\n    └── download_injector.ts\n```\n\n### Error Handling Strategy\n\n- **Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff\n- **Permission Errors**: Show user-friendly message with instructions\n- **Storage Errors**: Graceful degradation with in-memory fallback\n- **Invalid URLs**: Skip with warning, don't fail entire batch\n- **File System Errors**: Retry with alternative filename\n- **Extension Errors**: Log to console, show user notification\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n- **Memory Usage**: Limit concurrent downloads and stored history\n- **CPU Usage**: Debounce UI updates during rapid progress changes\n- **Network Usage**: Respect rate limits, implement request queuing\n- **Storage Usage**: Compress stored data, implement cleanup routines\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- **URL Validation**: Validate all URLs before downloading\n- **File Type Validation**: Only allow image file types\n- **Content Security Policy**: Comply with Manifest V3 CSP requirements\n- **User Privacy**: No tracking, minimal data collection\n- **Malicious Content**: Scan downloaded files for safety\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and services\n- **Integration Tests**: Test Chrome API interactions\n- **E2E Tests**: Test complete download workflows\n- **Mock Strategy**: Mock Chrome APIs for testing\n- **Test Data**: Use provided HTML fixtures for page detection tests\n\n# Order of steps in implementation plan\n\nThe implementation plan should adhere to the phases in the order below. But I want you to break down each phase into many small steps.\n\n1. **Setup and Configuration Phase**\n   - Update manifest.json with required permissions\n   - Add download directory setting to settings system\n   - Create TypeScript interfaces for download data structures\n   - Set up Chrome storage schema for download data\n\n2. **Page Detection and Content Script Phase**\n   - Create page detector service for identifying supported pages\n   - Implement content script for injecting download button\n   - Create download button component with proper styling\n   - Add message passing between content script and background\n\n3. **Download Queue Management Phase**\n   - Implement download queue data structures\n   - Create download manager service\n   - Add image URL extraction logic for supported pages\n   - Display queued downloads in Downloads tab (without actual downloading)\n\n4. **Download Implementation Phase**\n   - Integrate Chrome Downloads API\n   - Implement parallel download management\n   - Add progress tracking and status updates\n   - Handle basic download completion\n\n5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases Phase**\n   - Add retry logic for failed downloads\n   - Implement timeout handling\n   - Add file naming conflict resolution\n   - Handle network and permission errors\n   - Add download cancellation functionality\n\n6. **UI/UX Polish Phase**\n   - Add bulk operations for downloads\n   - Implement filtering and sorting\n   - Add download statistics\n   - Improve visual feedback and animations\n   - Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility\n\n7. **Testing and Quality Assurance Phase**\n   - Write comprehensive unit tests\n   - Add integration tests for Chrome API usage\n   - Test error scenarios and edge cases\n   - Verify lint and type checking compliance\n   - Performance testing and optimization\n\n8. **Final Review and Documentation Phase**\n   - Code review for idiomatic patterns\n   - Security review for potential vulnerabilities\n   - Performance review and optimization\n   - Update documentation and comments\n   - Final testing across all supported pages"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2177,"cache_read_input_tokens":15469,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQjLcDzmDqvrRV4uQobV9","type":"assistant","uuid":"edf0832c-ab8c-4b6f-bea9-5f88f25d0294","timestamp":"2025-07-03T03:01:44.035Z"}

Thus, it should be encapsulated in one place, and given the logic that's specific to the page to download images from. It will use that logic to get the page's title and URLs of images to download, and then queue the images to be downloaded.\n- The logic that will differ between supported pages will be:\n  - How to get the supported page's title. This will be a function that:\n    - Accepts a prop that is the page's document.\n    - Returns a string that is the page's title.\n  - How to get the URLs for the images that are downloadable. This will be a function that:\n    - Accepts a prop that is the page's document.\n    - Returns an array of strings that are the URLs of images to download.\n\n### Localhost Image Test Album\n\n- URL Domain: 127.0.0.1:4000\n- URL Path: /test.html\n- Logic to get the page's title:\n  1. Find the <h1> element that matches this CSS selector: `h1`\n  2. Return the text content of the <h1> element that was found.\n- Logic to get the URLs for the downloadable images:\n  1. Find the <a> elements that match this CSS selector: `.image-container a`\n  2. Return the `href` attribute of each <a> element that was found.\n\nThe HTML for an example page to use for testing can be found at @src/test/fixtures/localhost_image_test_album.html\n\n### Pictoa Image Album\n\n- URL Domain: pictoa.com\n- URL Path: /albums/\\*\n- Logic to get the page's title:\n  1.

Here are my questions:\n\n## Clarifying Questions\n\n1. **Content Script Integration**: The instructions mention adding a download icon to supported pages, but don't specify how this will be implemented. Should this be done via:\n   - A content script that injects the download button into the page?\n   - A browser action that detects when the user is on a supported page?\n   - Some other mechanism?\n\n2. **Data Storage**: How should the download queue and download status be persisted? Should this use:\n   - Chrome's storage API (sync or local)?\n   - In-memory storage that resets on browser restart?\n   - A combination of both?\n\n3. **Chrome Download API Permissions**: The instructions mention using Chrome's Download API, but the project will need specific permissions in the manifest. What permissions should be requested?\n\n4. **Error Handling Specifics**: What specific errors and edge cases should be handled? For example:\n   - Network failures during download\n   - Invalid image URLs\n   - Download directory doesn't exist or isn't writable\n   - Download quota exceeded\n   - Duplicate downloads\n\n5. **User Interface Components**: What specific Mantine components should be used for the Downloads tab UI elements like:\n   - Progress bars\n   - Status icons\n   - Retry buttons\n   - Group headers\n\n6. **Testing Strategy**: The instructions mention testing but don't specify:\n   - Should there be integration tests that actually download files?\n   - How should the Chrome Download API be mocked in tests?\n   - Should there be E2E tests for the content script functionality?\n\n7. **File Naming**: How should downloaded files be named if there are conflicts (e.g., multiple images with the same filename)?\n\n8. **Download Directory Structure**: Should the download directory structure be:\n   - `[download_directory]/[page_title]/[image_filename]`\n   - Or should there be additional organization (e.g., by date, domain)?\n\nNow I'll create the optimized instructions file that addresses these gaps:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1093,"cache_read_input_tokens":18891,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQjLtGJcWfcDx1RjQBp3g","type":"assistant","uuid":"8fef9ec7-9ad9-4831-b3d9-462e8f599bef","timestamp":"2025-07-03T03:04:27.355Z"}

The instructions mention Chrome's Download API and content script injection, but don't specify the exact permissions needed.\n\n2. **Content Script Injection**: How should the extension detect when a user navigates to a supported page? Should it use content scripts with specific match patterns, or use the tabs API to monitor URL changes?\n\n3. **Download Directory Setting**: The instructions mention a \"download directory\" setting that the extension stores, but this setting isn't defined in the current codebase. Should this be added to the existing settings system, and what should be the default value?\n\n4. **Image Filename Generation**: How should filenames be generated for downloaded images? Should they preserve the original filename from the URL, use a sequential numbering system, or handle name conflicts in a specific way?\n\n5. **Data Persistence**: How should the download queue and status be persisted? Should it survive browser restarts, or is it acceptable to lose the queue when the browser closes?\n\n6. **Error Handling Specifics**: What specific error scenarios should be handled? Network timeouts, permission errors, disk space issues, invalid URLs, etc.?\n\n7. **UI/UX Details**: \n   - What specific icons should be used for each download status?\n   - Should there be any animations or transitions?\n   - What should happen if the download directory doesn't exist or becomes inaccessible?\n\n8. **Testing Strategy**: Should there be specific test files created for the supported pages, or should the implementation rely on the existing test.html?\n\n9. **Performance Considerations**: Should there be any limits on the number of images that can be queued from a single page, or the total queue size across all pages?\n\n10. **Background Script Communication**: How should the content script communicate with the background script and the React app? Should it use Chrome's messaging API, and what message format should be used?\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating the optimized instructions file based on reasonable assumptions for these gaps, or would you prefer to provide specific answers to these questions first?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2100,"cache_read_input_tokens":15469,"output_tokens":486,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQjMB3GmJcPp5ws3ov84a","type":"assistant","uuid":"44bd656d-1e12-41eb-bb2e-988d128e35b0","timestamp":"2025-07-03T03:08:16.209Z"}

The box has rounded corners, is anchored to the bottom-right corner of the page, and floats on top of the page.\n\n## Downloading\n\n- Allow a maximum of 10 images to be downloaded in parallel per page. When a download finishes or fails, start downloading the next image in the queue for that page.\n- Use Chrome's Download API to download images and track each download's progress, completion, and errors.\n- Downloaded images should be stored in a directory whose name is the page's title. And that directory must be inside of the \"download directory\" setting that the extension stores (accessible via `useSettings().settings.download_directory`).\n\n## Queue Limits\n\n- Maximum 200 images per page to prevent overwhelming the system\n- Maximum 1000 total images across all pages in the queue\n- Display a warning message to the user if they try to exceed these limits\n\n## \"Downloads\" tab\n\nThe section describes how information about queued images are displayed in the \"Downloads\" tab.\n\n- Downloaded images are grouped by page that they were downloaded from.\n  - Each group has a title, which is the extracted title from the page that the images were downloaded from.\n  - Under each group's title, the page's URL is displayed as a link. Clicking the link opens the page in a new browser tab.\n  - Each group has an icon representing the aggregate status of the downloads in the group. The status is defined with the following logic:\n    - If any images are being downloaded, the group's status is \"downloading\".\n    - Else if any images failed to download, the group's status is \"failed\".\n    - Else if any images are cancelled, the group's status is \"cancelled\".\n    - Else if any images are pending, the group's status is \"pending\".\n    - Else (all images have downloaded successfully), the group's status is \"downloaded\".\n  - Each group has an icon/button to retry all of the downloads that have failed or are pending.\n  - Each group has an icon/button to cancel all of the downloads whose status is not \"downloaded\".\n- The following information should be displayed for each queued image:\n  - Status: pending, downloading, downloaded, failed, or cancelled.

This way users don't lose their download progress if they accidentally close the browser. The queue should be stored with a key like \"download_queue\" and include all necessary information about each download (URL, filename, status, page title, etc.).\n\n## Testing\n\nTest files are available for both supported page types:\n- Localhost test: `src/test/fixtures/localhost_image_test_album.html`\n- Pictoa test: `src/test/fixtures/pictoa_image_test_album.html`\n\n# Technical Implementation Details\n\n## Chrome Extension Permissions\n\nAdd these permissions to manifest.json:\n- `\"downloads\"` - for Chrome's Download API\n- `\"activeTab\"` - to inject content scripts on supported pages\n- `\"storage\"` - for persisting download queue and settings\n- `\"scripting\"` - for Manifest V3 content script injection\n\n## Page Detection and Content Script Injection\n\nUse the tabs API in the background script to monitor URL changes with `chrome.tabs.onUpdated`, then dynamically inject content scripts when a supported page is detected.\n\n## Communication Architecture\n\nThe content script must use Chrome's messaging API to communicate with the background script. To tell the background script to queue images for downloading, the message must be passed as JSON with this format:\n\n```json\n{\n  type: string,\n  payload: {\n    pageTitle: string,\n    pageUrl: string,\n    imageUrls: string[]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor example:\n```json\n{\n  type: \"QUEUE_IMAGES\",\n  payload: {\n    pageTitle: \"Test Album 123\",\n    pageUrl: \"https://test.com/123\",\n    imageUrls: [\n      \"https://test.com/123/1.jpg\",\n      \"https://test.com/123/2.jpg\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe background script must then update Chrome storage, which the React app can listen to via the `useChromeStorage` hook.\n\n# Order of steps in implementation plan\n\nThe implementation plan should adhere to the phases in the order below. But I want you to break down each phase into many small steps.\n\n1. Add the download button (🚀 icon) on supported pages.\n2.
