The system will detect supported pages, display a download button, queue images for downloading, and show download progress in a \"Downloads\" tab. The implementation follows a phased approach with comprehensive error handling and testing.\n\n## Milestone 1.1: Core Infrastructure Setup\n\n**Objective**: Establish foundation for download functionality\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n\n- Manifest updated with correct permissions\n- Core types defined and exported\n- Debug logging configured\n\n### Step 1.1.1: Update Chrome Extension Manifest\n\n- Add required permissions to `manifest.json`:\n  - `\"activeTab\"` for content script injection\n  - `\"scripting\"` for Manifest V3 content script injection\n  - `\"downloads\"` for Chrome Downloads API\n  - `\"storage\"` for accessing download directory settings\n- Add host permissions for supported domains:\n  - `\"*://127.0.0.1:4000/*\"` for localhost testing\n  - `\"*://pictoa.com/*\"` for Pictoa image albums\n- Verify existing permissions are compatible\n\n### Step 1.1.2: Create Core TypeScript Types\n\n- Create `src/types/downloads.ts` with:\n  - `DownloadItem` interface (id, filename, url, status, progress)\n  - `DownloadGroup` interface (id, title, url, status, items)\n  - `DownloadState` interface (groups)\n  - `DownloadStatus` enum (queued, downloading, downloaded, failed, cancelled)\n  - `GroupStatus` enum (downloading, failed, cancelled, queued, downloaded)\n  - Message types for Chrome runtime communication\n\n### Step 1.1.3: Create Page Detection Types\n\n- Create `src/types/pages.ts` with:\n  - `SupportedPage` interface (domain, path pattern, title extractor, image URL extractor)\n  - `PageExtractor` interface for title and image URL extraction functions\n  - Configuration for localhost and Pictoa pages\n\n### Step 1.1.4: Set Up Debug Logging\n\n- Create download-specific debug namespaces using existing debug package:\n  - `download:content` for content script logging\n  - `download:background` for background script logging\n  - `download:react` for React app logging\n- Follow existing project patterns for debug logging\n\n### Step 1.1.5: Linting and Type Checking\n\n- Run and fix all linting issues:\n  - `npm run lint` passes without warnings\n  - TypeScript compilation succeeds\n  - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary\n  - Consistent code formatting\n\n### Step 1.1.6: User Code Review\n\n- Stop making changes to files\n- Ask the user to review the code\n- Proceed to the next step once the user has finished reviewing the code\n\n### Step 1.1.7: Commit the Changes\n\n- Use the `git commit` command to commit the changes to the Git repository\n- Write a concise commit message that captures the name of the step and a summary of the changes"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11338,"cache_read_input_tokens":10241,"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQtty2KtRz3cEGQF6hHgX","type":"assistant","uuid":"d59554cd-d3ba-4936-ab48-9c6bf18c0f8d","timestamp":"2025-07-08T04:10:41.738Z"}
