## Nick Hoffman's Dotfiles

Dotfiles I have used and tweaked for the past couple of years. They're designed to work on GNU/Linux, and am slowly modifying them to work on Mac OS X, too.

## Setup

<table>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Kubuntu</td>
    <td>Konsole</td>
    <td>Bash</td>
    <td>ViM</td>
    <td>Git</td>

    <td>tmux</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Install

2. Run `linker.sh` to clone and symlink to the dotfiles. You'll be prompted to overwrite any existing files.
